# Design Patterns

The Common Core Ontologies include several design patterns that can be reused across domains to model common scenarios. These patterns provide standardized approaches to representing complex relationships and concepts.

## Available Patterns

- [Geospatial Tracking](geospatial-tracking)
- [Information Entity Patterns](information)

## Benefits of Design Patterns

Design patterns in ontologies offer several advantages:

- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform representation across different parts of your knowledge base
- **Reusability**: Apply tested solutions to recurring modeling challenges
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and maintain ontologies that follow established patterns
- **Interoperability**: Enhance integration with other systems that recognize the same patterns

## Using Design Patterns

Each pattern page includes:
- A description of the pattern's purpose
- The key classes and properties involved
- Example usage scenarios
- Code examples showing how to implement the pattern

## BFO Practitioner Certificate 
### Overview
The BFO Practitioner Certificate introduces students to the fundamentals of modeling data with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), a top-level architecture used by over 500 ontology and knowledge graph projects across the world. Students gain hands-on modeling experiences, working with subject-matter experts on active open-source projects leveraging BFO. Additionally, students will learn the philosophcal and practial motivations for the distinctions drawn in BFO. This certificate course covers necessary building blocks for mastering differences and similarities across alternative top-level ontology architectures as well as for leveraging open-source ontologies to model specific domains, such as biomedicine, cyber security, climate change, and immigration, among many others. Throughout the course, students will learn to develop, curate, validate, and implement BFO in support of enterprise solutions. 

### Duration
8 Hours

### Course objectives
In this course, you will develop competency with the following topics:
- Top-Level Principles of BFO 
- The BFO Hierarchy 
- Formal Implementations of BFO 
- Translating from Natural Language into BFO 
- Implementations BFO-Conformant Design Patterns 
- Extending BFO by Downward Population 
- Validating Extensions of BFO

### Intended audience
This course is intended for:
- Individuals responsible for articulating the benefits of leveraging BFO to others
- Individuals interested in gaining hands-on training modeling with BFO
- Knowledge representation, Ontology or Data Architects/Engineers

Participants will gain expertise with standard ontology engineering best practices, tools, and modeling strategies. Participants will become proficient in constructing, maintaining, and curating ontologies in a modern software development workflow.

## Ontology Engineer Certificate 
### Overview
The Ontology Engineer Certificate introduces students to the fundamentals of ontology engineering, focused on the creation, updating, maintaining, and validating of ontologies and knowledge graphs in contemporary system architectures. This course provides students hands-on training to master the semantic web stack, equipping students with the competency needed to integrate and curate ontologies effectively. This certificate serves as a stepping stone for certificates covering specialized topics such as optimized information extraction, semantic web devOps best practices, description logic, and cybersecurity related to the semantic web. 

### Duration
12 Hours

### Course objectives
In this course, you will develop competency with the following topics:
- RDF, RDFS, and a zoo of W3C standards
- OWL2 Full, OWL2 DL Direct Semantics, and OWL Profiles
- Principles of Version Control using GitHub
- Open-Source CI/CD tools for ontology development, e.g. Protege, ROBOT, OnTop, GraphDB
- Extraction and Validation with the Semantic Web Stack, e.g. SPARQL, SHACL 

### Intended audience
This course is intended for:
- Individuals using or interested in leveraging semantic web technologies in existing workflows
- Knowledge representation, Ontology or Data Architects/Engineers
- Existing users of BFO or extensions of BFO
- DevOps and SysOps Administrators
- Software Developers

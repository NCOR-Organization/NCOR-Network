# Basic Formal Ontology ISO/IEC 21838:2 Specialist

Participants will gain facility with applying BFO classes and relations to a range of practical modeling problems while maintaining conformance to the top-level ontology 21838:2 specification. A standard training package consists of four days, 4 hours per day, for a total of 16 hours. An expedited training package consists of two days, 8 hours per day, for a total of 16 hours. Topics covered include:

* Construction and application of BFO-conformant design patterns
* Translating natural language into BFO-conformant terminology
* Use of BFO and extensions - such as the Common Core Ontologies suite - to represent intelligence gathering, defense, and cyber security
* Motivation for and critical analysis of the BFO hierarchy
* Comparison of BFO modeling choice-points to those found in other top-level ontology architectures
 
## Tentative Schedule (4 Day)

### Day 1
- Top-Level Principles of BFO
- The BFO Hierarchy
- Formal Implementations of BFO

### Day 2
- From Natural Language to BFO Implementations
- BFO-Conformant Design Patterns
- Participant Evaluation

### Day 3
- Extending BFO using Common Core Ontologies
- BFO/CCO-Conformant Design Patterns
- From Natural Language to BFO/CCO

### Day 4
- Upper-Level Rivals to BFO: DOLCE, YAMATO
- Critical Comparison of Upper-Level Ontologies
- Participant Evaluation
 
Expedited schedule merges Day 1 and 2, and Day 3 and 4, holding an evaluation each day. Participants will be evaluated by way of two exams, consisting of multiple choice and essay questions designed to check competency with the material covered. Successful completion of this credential requires an average of 70 across both exams.
 
# Applied Ontology Engineering Specialist 

Aimed at cultivating expertise with ontology engineering technologies, and promoting facility with constructing, maintaining, and curating ontologies in a modern software development workflow.
